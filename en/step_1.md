The starter project to the right has some code already written for you.

Click on the small triangle next to line 3 to collapse the `<head>`.

Add in an `<h1>` tag with some text to add a header to your webpage.

The `<h1>` tag is used to define the main heading of your webpage. It's like the title of a book.

--- /task ---

Your code should look like this:

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 27
line_highlights: 30
---
  <body>
    <!-- The page header code goes here -->
    <header>
      <h1>Draw anime with me</h1>
    </header>
--- /code ---
</div>


<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">

### Tip

When you open a tag like `<h1>`, the code editor will automatically add a closing tag `</h1>` for you.

</div>
