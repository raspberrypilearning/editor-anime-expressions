<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Add a header</h2>

--- task ---

Your [starter](https://staging-editor.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/editor-anime-expressions-starter) project contains some HTML that you will learn more about throughout the project. <!--Starter Project linked for testing purposes only-->

Click on the small triangle next to line 3 to collapse the `<head>`{:.language-html}.

Add in an `<h1>`{:.language-html} tag with some text to add a header to your webpage.

The `<h1>` {:.language-html} tag is used to define the main heading of your webpage. It's like the title of a book.

Your code should look like this:

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 27
line_highlights: 30
---
  <body>
    <!-- The page header code goes here -->
    <header>
      <h1>Draw anime with me</h1>
    </header>
--- /code ---
</div>

--- /task ---

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">

### Tip

When you open a tag like `<h1>`{:.language-html}, the code editor will automatically add a closing tag `</h1>`{:.language-html} for you.
