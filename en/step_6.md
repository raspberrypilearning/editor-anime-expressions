Fantastic effort! You added an image to your web page.

Add a paragraph of text in `<p></p>`{:.language-html} tags to describe how to draw the love anime facial expression. 

You can copy the paragraph and paste it into your code: `<p>To make your anime character look like they are in love, replace the eyes with rounded hearts. You can add three more hearts inside for a fun effect.</p>`{:.language-html}

Add `<strong>`{:.language-html} tags around the word 'love'.
