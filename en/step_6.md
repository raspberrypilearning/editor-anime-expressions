<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Add some descriptive text</h2>

--- task ---

Fantastic effort! You added an image to your web page.

Add a paragraph of text in `<p></p>` tags to describe how to draw the love anime facial expression. 

You can copy the paragraph and paste it into your code: `<p>To make your anime character look like they are in love, replace the eyes with rounded hearts. You can add three more hearts inside for a fun effect.</p>`

Add `<strong>` tags around the word 'love'.
