<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Add more images</h2>

--- task ---

You've been amazing all through!

There are two more images that you can use in your project; `happy.png` and `annoyed.png`.

Use the other two images and add descriptions and styling to them, in `<section>`{:.language-html} tags, as you did with the `love.png` image.
