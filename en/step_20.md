If you are following the [Intro to web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro-simplified) path, you can move on to the [Top five emojis](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/top-5-emoji-list-simplified) project. In this project, make a list of your favourite five emojis, with use of animation effects.

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Watch the animations on this web page. How often do they repeat? Can you spot a list, quote, and link?
