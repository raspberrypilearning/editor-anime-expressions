<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Add a paragraph</h2>

--- task ---

Great work learning about more `<h>`{:.language-html} tags.

Underneath your `<h2>`{:.language-html} heading code, add the paragraph `<p>`{:.language-html} tags. Between the `<p>`{:.language-html} tags, add in some introductory text.

Your code should look like this:

<div class="c-project-code">

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 33
line_highlights: 37
---
    <!-- The main content for the web page goes between the main tags -->
    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>Facial expressions</h2>
        <p>Take a look at these facial expressions and try them in your own drawings.</p>
      </section>
        <!-- The first drawing and instructions go here -->

### Tip

In HTML, a "paragraph" tag `<p>`{:.language-html} is used to put sentences together, making your webpage look tidy and easy to read.
