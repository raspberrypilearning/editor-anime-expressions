<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Add more styles</h2>

You can add more than one CSS class to a tag. Your CSS file has three classes called `primary`, `secondary` and `teriary`.

The `primary` class sets a contrasting background and text colour for most of the main content. 

The `secondary` and `tertiary` classes set additional colour combinations that look good with the colours in the `primary` class.

Add the `secondary` class to your `footer` code to apply a different colour background to your footer. 

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 55
line_highlights: 56
---
    <!-- web page footer -->
    <footer class="border-top secondary">

--- /code ---
</div>

<div class="c-project-code">

    <!-- The main content for the web page goes between the main tags -->
